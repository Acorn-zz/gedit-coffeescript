This project adds [CoffeeScript] syntax highlighting to the gedit text editor.

[CoffeeScript]: http://coffeescript.org

### Installation and Use

1. Download and place coffee_script.lang in `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs`
    > Note: if those directories don't exist, make them and gedit will know what to do.

2. Run gedit and open a CoffeeScript file or Cakefile.

Patches and improvements welcome!
